        <fieldset id="infos">
          <ul>  
            <li><span class="bold">1791</span> - Széchenyi was born in Vienna</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1809</span> - He fought with distinction at the battle of Raab brought about the subsequent junction of the two Austrian armies by conveying a message across the Danube to General Chasteler at the risk of his life.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1815 to 1821</span> - Széchenyi traveled extensively in Europe, visiting France, England, Italy, Greece and the Levant, and studying their institutions.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1825</span> - By supporting the proposal of the representative of Sopron county, Pál Nagy, to establish the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Széchenyi donated the full annual income of his estates that year, 60,000 forints, towards it.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1827</span> - He organized the Nemzeti Kaszinó, or National Casino, a forum for the patriotic Hungarian nobility. The Casino had an important role in the reform movement by providing an institute for political dialogues.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1930</span> - Besides his comprehensive political ideas, he concentrated on the development of transportation infrastructure, as he understood its importance for development and communication. Part of this program was the regulation of the flow of waters of the lower Danube to improve navigation, in order to open it to commercial shipping and trade from Buda to the Black Sea. He became the leading figure of the Danube Navigation Committee, which completed its work in ten years. Previously the river had been dangerous for ships and was not efficient as an international trading route. Széchenyi was the first to promote steamboats on the Danube, the Tisza (Theiss), and Lake Balaton, also measures to open up Hungary to trade and development.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1836</span> - Széchenyi married Countess Crescencia von Seilern und Aspang in Buda. They had three children: <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Júlia Széchenyi</span> - who died at the age of three months.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Béla Szécheny</span> - who traveled to Eastern countries several times.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Ödön Széchenyi</span> - who died as a Turkish pasha.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">1841</span> - Pamphlet People of the East (Kelet Népe), Count Széchenyi responded to Kossuth's reform proposals. Széchenyi believed that economic, political and social reforms should proceed slowly and with care, in order to avoid the potentially disastrous prospect of violent interference from the Habsburg dynasty. Széchenyi was aware of the spread of Kossuth's ideas in Hungarian society, which he took to overlook the need for a good relationship with the Habsburg dynasty.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1848</span> -  The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 developed in the direction of Hungary attempting to break away from Habsburg rule, an attempt eventually crushed with severe repression by the Austrian authorities – both of which very much contrary to Széchenyi's way of thinking and his vision for Hungary's future. In early September 1848, Széchenyi's nervous state brought depression and a breakdown; his doctor ordered him to the private Asylum of Dr. Gustav Görgen in Oberdöbling. With his wife's care, he gradually recovered enough to resume writing but did not return to politics. He wrote the book Önismeret (Self awareness) about children, education and pedagogy. He also wrote Ein Blick (One Look), a study of the deep political problems of Hungary at the beginning of the 1850s.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1860</span> - Still suffering from depression, Széchenyi committed suicide by a gunshot to his head on 8 April 1860, in his 68th year.</li>
